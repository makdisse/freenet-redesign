				<label class="radio">
					<input type="radio" name="optionsRadios1" id="optionsRadios2" value="option2">
					<strong>NORMAL</strong><br> I trust my friend a little. Share some information, but take some precautions. Moderate performance gain.

				<legend>3 - Do you want your other friends to be able to see and connect to this friend?</legend>
				<p class="muted">If you let your friends see this friend, and this friend see your friends, it will improve performance significantly.

				<label class="radio">

					<strong>YES</strong><br> Tell my other friends about this friend, and tell this friend about my other friends. They will be able to connect immediately even if I am offline, improving performance significantly.

	Why you should connect to your friends running Freenet
</legend>

<p>You can improve Freenet's security by connecting to your friends. That is, to people you actually know who also run Freenet. These can be online acquaintances, but do not add connections to total strangers, as adding strangers as Friends will not improve security much and will cause problems for the network as a whole if lots of people do it. When you have added enough Friends, so that at least 5 are online at all times, you can increase your network security level to HIGH, and only connect to Friends, which is called "darknet mode". This makes it much harder for an attacker to even find out that you are running Freenet, and makes most attacks against your anonymity much harder. Freenet will make encrypted connections to your friends directly over the Internet, so only add people you can already be easily connected to (family, coworkers, real life friends, online friends).</p>
<p>In order to connect to a Friend, you need to exchange noderefs with them. A noderef is a small file which contains the information needed for their copy of Freenet ("Freenet node") to connect to yours. You must add their noderef and they must add your noderef, for the two nodes to connect. See below for your noderef.</p>
<p>Freenet has not yet managed to download the Windows installer, however you can get it over Freenet <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/SSK@sabn9HY9MKLbFPp851AO98uKtsCtYHM9rqB~A5cCGW4,3yps2z06rLnwf50QU4HvsILakRBYd4vBlPtLv0elUts,AQACAAE/installer-1444">here</a>.</p>
<p>Freenet has not yet managed to download the non-Windows installer, however you can get it over Freenet <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/SSK@sabn9HY9MKLbFPp851AO98uKtsCtYHM9rqB~A5cCGW4,3yps2z06rLnwf50QU4HvsILakRBYd4vBlPtLv0elUts,AQACAAE/wininstaller-1444">here</a>. This is a jar file which must be opened with java; hopefully your friend can double click on it, but if that doesn't work try opening a command line and typing "java -jar freenet-latest-installer-nonwindows.jar".</p>
